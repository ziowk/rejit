    A NFA is essentially a graph, made of states connected by edges. All edges

    in the NFA: `_start` state from which the automaton starts, and `_end`
    state, which is the accepting state. For details regarding states and edges
    see `State` class docs.

    A NFA object can be used to determine if a string belongs to the NFA's
    accepted language. The NFA's accepted language is equivalent to a regular
    expression, which means that the NFA can be used for matching them.

    NFA objects should only be created with NFA generation methods or
    combined using NFA combination methods. NFA generation methods create new
    basic NFA objects. NFA combination methods transform input NFA objects
    to create complex ones out of them.

    NFA class uses a concept of object validity. Only a valid object can
    be used to `accept` strings, or be passed to NFA's combination methods.
    
    Valid objects are ones created with NFA's generation methods or returned
    from NFA's combination methods.

    Invalid objects are ones passed to NFA's combination methods. If user wants
    to use a NFA object after it was passed to a NFA's combining method, user
    should create a copy of the NFA using `deepcopy` method from standard
    library's `copy` module.
